# Pricing-derivatives-in-a-Black-Scholes-setting-through-Montecarlo-simulations
The project consists in developing an algorithm that allows the user to calculate the price of commonly traded options, to have the most common pool we use the stocks of SP500. The pricing Algorithm is based on Montecarlo simulations. This is among the most popular tool to predict outcomes that involve random variables. Montecarlo method gives us the possibility, if the number of simulations is high enough, to estimate with a great degree of precision the prices. To extend the pricing algorithm also to American options the Longstaff-Schwartz model is implemented. This type of approach leaves also room for possible parallelization in case the number of simulations exceeds a certain threshold. To increase the speed of execution we make the user choose if he wants to use a C++ compiler, we also give him the possibility to set some parameters such as the number of steps he wants to have in a year, the stock price, the date from which estimate. All these features can be chosen by the User through a visual interface.
